Theory:

 1.	java.io.*;

    	class File
    	absolute and relative paths (differences)

    	byte Stream (InputStream, OutputStream)

    	char streams (Reader, Writer)

    	!!! always close OutputStream and Writer

2. Java collections
		(xmind file, download and open)

Practice:


1. Finish all methods and inner classes in binarySearchTree mark as TODO

2. Make unit tests for BinarySearchTree

3. Make refactoring if it possible for BinarySearchTree, check remove method

4. Finish all previous tasks

5.* Make BalancedBinaryTree, or try to write algorithm in mind map.

6.* Implement class FileHelper
       - find file(dir)
       - show directoryContent
       - show file (content)
       - delete file or dir
       - copy file(dir)
       - move(rename) file or dir
       - compare content of files
       - deepFind (do search in file name and in file content by keyword)
           * result of search can be written into file

       -* find in file system without recursion
